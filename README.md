# Okazanta

Okazanta is modern open source status page software that anyone can use to create a clean and accessible status page for any kind of services.

This project is a fork of the currently unmaintained [Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet) project. It was created with the initial aim of modernising cachet, squashing bugs, and updating security.

Further down the line we intend to update the functionality and to add server uptime status monitors to create a completely automated monitoring and status page solution

## Okawhat?

The name (loosely) comes from the Esperanto word for occurrence or incident. Both of those words seem a good fit for an app that reports what is happening, the OK at the sart of the word implies a 'positive status check', and since the project is universal and open to all, why not a little bit of Esperanto :)

## Get involved

There is a huge amount to do, even to pull the existing code up to today before any other changes or steps forward, and we are happy for any help. 

Please DO start issues, comment on others, make PRs, and come and take part in discussion on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/4CtKuuHrqJ).
