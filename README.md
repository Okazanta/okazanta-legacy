# Okazanta

Okazanta is modern open source status page software that anyone can use to create a clean and accessible status page for any kind of services.

This project is a fork of the currently unmaintained [Cachet](https://github.com/CachetHQ/Cachet) project. It was created with the initial aim of modernising cachet, squashing bugs, and updating security.

Further down the line we intend to update the functionality and to add server uptime status monitors to create a completely automated monitoring and status page solution

## Okawhat?

The name (loosely) comes from the Esparanto word for occurrence or incident. Both of those words seem to fit for an app that reports what is happening, and since the project is universal and open to all, why not a little bit of Esperanto :)
